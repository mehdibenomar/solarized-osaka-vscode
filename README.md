```json
{
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "[Solarized Osaka]": {
            "editor.background": "#011620",
            "statusBar.background": "#01121a",

## Troubleshooting

Having issues with Solarized Osaka? Here are solutions to common problems:

### Common Issues

- **Colors don't match the screenshots**
  - Make sure you have selected "Solarized Osaka" (not "Solarized" or another variant)
  - Try reloading VS Code (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`)
  - Check if you have other extensions that might override theme colors

- **Terminal colors look inconsistent**
  - Add terminal color customization to your `settings.json`:
    ```json
    "terminal.integrated.colorScheme": "Solarized Dark",
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
      "terminal.background": "#011219",
      "terminal.foreground": "#839496"
    }
    ```

### Configuration Problems

- **Custom colors not applying**
  - Verify that you're targeting the correct theme name in your settings:
    ```json
    "[Solarized Osaka]": {
      // your customizations here
    }
    ```
  - Try restarting VS Code after making changes

- **Font ligatures not working**
  - Ensure your chosen font supports ligatures
  - Enable ligatures in your settings:
    ```json
    "editor.fontLigatures": true
    ```

### Known Limitations

- Full semantic highlighting is language-dependent and may vary in performance
- Some language extensions might override specific token colors
- Custom UI elements from third-party extensions may not follow the theme's color scheme
- Debug console may use slightly different colors than the integrated terminal

### Compatibility Notes

- Works best with VS Code 1.60.0 and above
- Compatible with most popular extensions, including GitHub Copilot, GitLens, and Prettier
- When using with bracket colorizers, may need custom configuration for optimal color harmony
- Older versions of VS Code may not support all color customizations
